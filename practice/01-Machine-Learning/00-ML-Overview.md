# Machine Learning Overview Test

1. What is machine learning?
> Machine learning is a subfield of AI where we solve problems with a model that we give a lot of data to. It finds patterns in that data and, based on probability, outputs the predictions without being explicitly programmed.

2. What are the main categories of ML and what do they mean?
> There are 3 main categories of ML: supervised learning, where the model gets labeled data as input, so input-output pairs. There's unsupervised learning, where the model gets unlabeled data, so it needs to figure out the label just based on the input data. And there's reinforcement learning, which is a different category. Here, there's an agent, that needs to take actions and reach different states in an environment, and the agent gets feedback of how good or bad its action was, so it can learn what to and not to do. And besides these three, there's hybrid learning techniques, that are techniques which combine elements of supervised and unsupervised learning.

3. What's the general ML workflow?
> First, we define the problem, then we obtain data, and we preprocess it (cleaning, transformation, normalization), then we split it into train and test sets. We choose the appropriate model, we tune hyperparameters and train the model on the training data, then we evaluate it on the testing data.

4. What libraries can we use for ML?
> There's NumPy, which is very common in ML projects, because it gives a base with its array and math functions. Pandas is useful for working with tables and structured data. Scikit-learn provides us models, and evaluation options. Matplotlib or seaborn are the libraries that help us visualize the data so we can visally see how our model performed.
