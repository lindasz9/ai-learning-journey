# Introduction â€“ My AI Learning Journey

## About Me
- I'm a 16-year-old motivated girl learning how to code.
- My goal is to become one of the smartest people in the tech industry â€” I know it's a big goal, but I like to dream big.

## Why I'm Learning AI
I've always been fascinated by how machines can "think," and now I want to go deeper into how they actually learn. I donâ€™t just want to use AI tools â€” I want to understand how they work from the inside out.

## Where I Am Right Now
- I know Python quite well.
- I'm competing in online and school contests.
- I've learned the basics of web development (frontend & backend).
- I have a little knowledge about machine learning, deep learning, and LLMs, but I donâ€™t understand them deeply yet.

## What I Want to Learn
- Basically every field of AI.
- How to use already built models.
- How to actually build models.

## Why I'm Documenting
- To track my growth and stay consistent.
- To look back and say "wow, I used to be so confused by this."
- To inspire others (and my future self) by showing that everyone starts somewhere.
- And who knows â€” maybe itâ€™ll impress someone reading this during a future job interview ðŸ‘€ (Yes, I see you, hiring manager.)
