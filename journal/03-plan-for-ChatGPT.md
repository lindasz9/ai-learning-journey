# 🧠 AI Learning Journal

## 📌 Overview

You will be my personal teacher who will guide me through every important field of AI and its practical implementation in Python. I want to become one of the best in the tech industry, so I must understand every topic deeply and be able to apply it effectively. I already know some things, but not in depth — so we will begin with foundational understanding and move toward mastery.

This journey is fully personalized and deeply organized. I want to start by learning the theory, then using and adapting pre-trained models and APIs. Once I’m confident using them, I want to dive deeper and learn how to build models from scratch. 

We already had a chat where we discussed this learning structure. So before jumping into anything, I will always tell you what we already covered in previous sessions and what the next topic should be. Here's the full plan of what I want to learn:

# Supervised Learning

## 🧠 What is Supervised Learning?

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset.  
Each data point includes both the input (features) and the correct output (label or target).

---

## 📂 Types of Supervised Learning Tasks

### 1. **Regression**
- Predicts **continuous numeric values**.
- **Real-world examples**: 
  - House prices
  - Temperature
  - Stock values

### 2. **Classification**
- Predicts **categorical labels** (classes).
- **Real-world examples**: 
  - Spam detection
  - Image classification
  - Tumor benign/malignant

## 📘 Regression Algorithms

### 🔹 Linear Regression
- **How it works**: Models a linear relationship (`y = wx + b`) between input features and the target.
- **When to use**: Simple problems with continuous target values and a linear relationship between inputs and output.
- **Strengths**:  
  - Easy to implement  
  - Easy to interpret  
  - Easy to visualize  
- **Weaknesses**:  
  - Fails with non-linear patterns  
  - Sensitive to outliers

---

### 🔹 Ridge & Lasso Regression
- **How it works**: Add *regularization* terms to linear regression to penalize large *coefficients*.
- **When to use**: High-dimensional data or when multicollinearity is present.
- **Strengths**:  
  - Reduces overfitting  
  - Improves generalization  
- **Weaknesses**:  
  - Still assumes linear relationships  
- **Types**:  
  - **Ridge**: L2 penalty — shrinks *coefficients* but keeps all.  
  - **Lasso**: L1 penalty — can shrink some *coefficients* to zero (feature selection).  
  - **Elastic Net**: Combines L1 and L2 penalties — balances feature selection and coefficient shrinkage.

## 🌲 Ensemble and Boosting Methods

### 🔹 Random Forest
- **How it works**: Builds multiple decision trees using random subsets of features and samples (*bagging*). Each tree gives a prediction; the final result is based on majority vote (classification) or average (regression).
- **When to use**: When you need a strong *baseline model* for tabular data, especially when interpretability and *overfitting* control are important.
- **Strengths**:  
  - Handles missing values  
  - Reduces overfitting  
  - Works with both numerical and categorical data  
- **Weaknesses**:  
  - Large models can be slow to predict  
  - Less interpretable than single decision trees

---

### 🔹 Gradient Boosting
- **How it works**: Builds decision trees sequentially. Each new tree is trained to correct the residual errors of the previous one using *gradient descent* on a *loss function*.
- **When to use**: Complex structured data problems where accuracy is more important than interpretability or speed.
- **Strengths**:  
  - Extremely powerful and accurate  
  - Supports custom loss functions  
  - Handles missing values  
  - Supports parallelism  
- **Weaknesses**:  
  - Can overfit if not tuned properly  
  - More complex to configure and understand  
- **Types**:

## 🧠 Important Concepts

- **Bagging**: Short for bootstrap aggregating; a technique to improve model stability by training multiple models on random subsets of data.  
- **Baseline model**: A simple model used as a reference point to compare the performance of more complex models. It helps determine if a new model actually improves predictions.  
- **Bayes' theorem**: A formula that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions related to the event.  
- **Coefficient**: A numeric factor multiplying a feature in a model equation.  
- **Cross-validation**: A model evaluation method used to assess how the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent data set. Often used to find the best hyperparameters such as k in kNN.  
- **Decision boundaries**: The hypersurfaces or curves that separate different classes in a classification problem. A model uses decision boundaries to assign labels to input data points.  
- **Epsilon**: A margin of tolerance in Support Vector Regression within which no penalty is given for errors.  
- **Gradient descent**: A method used to make a model better by slowly changing its parameters to reduce mistakes.
- **Hyperplane**: A flat, (n-1)-dimensional subspace that separates classes in classification problems, especially in Support Vector Machines (SVM).  
- **Histogram**: A graph that groups data into bins and shows how many data points fall into each, helping visualize the data’s distribution.  
- **Kernel**: A function that transforms data into a higher-dimensional space to make it easier to find a linear separation (linear/polynomial/RBF).
- **Loss Function**: A function measuring how far predictions are from actual values.  
- **Optimization**: The process of adjusting model parameters to minimize the loss function.  
- **Overfitting**: When a model fits the training data too closely, capturing noise instead of the underlying pattern, resulting in poor generalization.  
- **Pruning**: The process of removing parts of a decision tree that provide little predictive power to reduce complexity and prevent overfitting.  
- **Regularization**: Adding penalties to model parameters to prevent overfitting.  
- **Sigmoid function**: A function that maps any real-valued number into a value between 0 and 1, commonly used to model probabilities.

## **Important** Rules for Notes

- Future notes don’t have to follow this exact format, since topics will naturally require different subtitles and sections. However, this serves as the base structure, which you can adapt as needed for each topic.
- You don’t need to keep the exact same subtitles — feel free to modify, add, or remove them depending on what fits the content best.
- Important for all notes: if there’s an unfamiliar or technical word in the text, enclose it in *asterisks* (enclose that word everytime it appears even when plural, except when defining it) and list it in the final section titled `## 🧠 Important Concepts`, in **alphabetical order** (or there's another option that I explain in the next paragraph). Do not add any other concept if it hasn't appeared yet. Do not add concepts that have alraedy been defined somewhere.
- If a concept appears in only one specific text section and is too narrow to be listed globally, define it immediately at the end of that section under `- **Extra**`. These terms should also be marked with *asterisks*.
- Concepts may be defined in several possible places (e.g., in `## 🧠 Important Concepts`, under specific text sections, or under `- **Extra**`), but **each concept should only be defined once**. If a concept appears again anywhere in the document (except where it's defined), it should still be written in *asterisks*.
- After any explanatory text section, if you feel a visual would help, insert an image placeholder like this:  
  `<img src="" height="300"/>`
- If there's a particularly important mathematical equation, feel free to include it.
- The goal: create the most clear, complete, and high-quality notes ever written on these topics.
