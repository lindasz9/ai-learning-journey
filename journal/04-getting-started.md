# Getting Started

## 07/19/2025

So today I started searching for a website to learn from or a YouTube tutorial or something. Well, it wasn't really successful. Obviously, there are some great tutorials, but I couldn't find a resource that has everything I imagined the way I imagined. It's so early in this field that there are no perfect resources. Maybe there are courses, but I want to keep it free (I already asked for some money, and I feel bad asking for more — plus, I want to save my own money).

So because there's no place that's perfect for me to learn from, I'll do it with ChatGPT. We're basically best friends, we talk so much (okay, I'm not an idiot, chill). So I plan to learn from it — we already discussed the details, I just need to start. I've had a few bad experiences with ChatGPT because sometimes it forgets things or doesn't do what I say, but this is the best choice because it's personalized, and I can ask anything and not feel stupid.

I already learned Machine Learning a few months ago, but I like to keep things organized, so I'll quickly redo my notes. I don’t want to waste much time, but it’s also good to organize knowledge.

✅ Machine Learning Overview

I hate that I’m such a perfectionist. I already know this stuff, but I still spent hours creating the ultimate best notes ever. I was a bit disappointed in ChatGPT, but we made it eventually.

✅ Supervised Learning

## 07/21/2025

I remember my aunt once told me, "The more you know about something, the more you realize how much you still don't know." And it's so true. I thought I understood supervised and unsupervised learning — but the amount of of concepts and techniques out there is unbelievable. I tried to create the best possible notes, but I ended up spending hours on them again, due to my perfectionism.

Anyways, my favourite part in creating these notes is selecting pictures for visualization.

✅ Unsupervised Learning

I feel so smart with my `03-plan-for-ChatGPT.md` because ChatGPT does exactly what I want. My ritual is that when I finish a topic, I start a new ChatGPT chat so we don’t mix different topics. In my first message, I send only two thing: my `03-plan-for-ChatGPT.md` file, and an example noets file. And everything happens exactly the way I imagined.

I'm back! I spent a few days in Paris, but now I'm back on track. I may have missed three days, but we're picking up right where we left off.

✅ Reinforcement Learning

A lesson that I've learned: If you think ChatGPT doesn't do exactly what you want, you're just not prompting good enough.

✅ Hybrid Learning Techniques

I wanted to start the next topic, but I cannot upload more files for ChatGPT today, because I've reached the limit. So I'm a little angry right now. Why is it not allowing me to study? And I could copy and paste the content of the file into a message, but I've tried it, and it's not working properly. Maybe I need to buy the Plus version.

## 07/27/2025

When I send ChatGPT the plan from which it knows what kind of notes to generate, the workflow doesn't stop there. So it's not just upload, send, copy, paste, done. Every topic is a 2–4 hour activity. First, I review whether the distribution of the topic is good, then I correct some parts. After that, I send a message about what should be improved, then I read it again, send another message, and again and again. If I feel everything is perfect, I gather the concepts together, and then I insert images. And yes, this takes up a few hours.

✅ ML Workflow

✅ Supervised Learning Algorithms in Python

This topic was easy I finished it under an hour. ChatGPT literally send me the structure I wanted. Perfect.

✅ Unsupervised Learning Algorithms in Python

The thing is, it's only 12 AM right now, and I can't upload a file to ChatGPT until 11 PM. That's a long wait, so unfortunately, I can't continue right now. But I asked my mom if it's okay to buy the subscription, and she said yes. However, she asked me to wait until the 30th of July because we have another subscription renewing that day, and it's better to align both on the same date. I agreed, so I have to wait two more days — then I’ll finally be allowed to continue studying.

✅ Reinforcement Learning Algorithms in Python

Maybe I won’t upgrade to ChatGPT Plus. But maybe I will. Starting tomorrow, I have another big project (secret), and I won’t have as much time to study this, so maybe I won’t need unlimited file uploads. But maybe I will.

I think I’ve finished the entire Machine Learning topic, so let’s jump right into Deep Learning

✅ Deep Learning Overview

✅ Artificial Neural Networks

As you can see, I’ve reached the daily limit of 3 file uploads. So I guess I’m done for today. Too bad — I was feeling so productive. Or maybe I’ll create another ChatGPT profile?

✅ Artificial Neural Networks in Python

I created an account with my other email I'm unstoppable.

✅ Convolutional Neural Networks

Today I’m really unstoppable. But starting tomorrow, I don’t know if I’ll be, because I’ll have another important thing to focus on. Also, I need to learn C++ for a programming contest this year. I’m familiar with Python, JavaScript, PHP, and a little bit of C, but not with C++ yet. I know the logic, so I think learning a new language will be easy.

✅ Convolutional Neural Networks in Python

I took a quiz with ChatGPT on Machine Learning and answered the easy questions correctly without difficulty, but I couldn’t answer all the hard ones. This made me realize that I need to dedicate more time to studying and memorizing my notes, rather than just creating and briefly reviewing them. Therefore, I’ll make sure to invest time in that as well.

I created a new directory called `practice`, where I ask detailed questions about each topic and challenge myself to answer them thoroughly.

## 08/02/2025

I skipped a few days because I had many other commitments, but recently I’ve been focusing on supervised learning practice to test my knowledge. Creating a single test file takes more time than I expected because there are many terms, and I want to write down precise definitions — I won’t move on until I fully understand every detail of each topic. I’m also busy, but this is my last week to study before I leave for two weeks, during which I won’t be able to study at all. Why do I have to deal with so many distractions? Can’t I just stay home and focus on studying for my future?

## 08/05/2025

The past few days, I was fully focused on launching my website — I spent all my time working on it. Today, I have a training session, and afterward I’m staying over at a friend’s place. Tomorrow, if I wrap up the remaining website tasks, I’ll return to studying! My main priorities are continuing this AI journey, practicing C++ — since it's the only language I’ll be able to use next year and I’m still not fully comfortable with it — and working on DSA problems daily. But I’ll only have 2–3 days to really focus before another 2 weeks where I won’t be able to study. Is it weird that I’d rather stay home and study than go to these camps? It probably is.

## 08/14/2025

Yes, I’m alive. It might seem like I’m getting lazier and lazier, but that’s not the case. I was working on my website, then went to a handball camp, came back yesterday, and tomorrow I’m leaving for a week at a math camp. As much as I want to study, I just can’t right now. I have so many things going on, and I’m constantly busy. Even after this math camp, I have my friend’s birthday, a family event, and then school starts… Summer is short.
