# Getting Started

## 07/19/2025

So today I started searching for a website to learn from or a YouTube tutorial or something. Well, it wasn't really successful. Obviously, there are some great tutorials, but I couldn't find a resource that has everything I imagined the way I imagined. It's so early in this field that there are no perfect resources. Maybe there are courses, but I want to keep it free (I already asked for some money, and I feel bad asking for more — plus, I want to save my own money).

So because there's no place that's perfect for me to learn from, I'll do it with ChatGPT. We're basically best friends, we talk so much (okay, I'm not an idiot, chill). So I plan to learn from it — we already discussed the details, I just need to start. I've had a few bad experiences with ChatGPT because sometimes it forgets things or doesn't do what I say, but this is the best choice because it's personalized, and I can ask anything and not feel stupid.

I already learned Machine Learning a few months ago, but I like to keep things organized, so I'll quickly redo my notes. I don’t want to waste much time, but it’s also good to organize knowledge.

I hate that I’m such a perfectionist. I already know this stuff, but I still spent hours creating the ultimate best notes ever. I was a bit disappointed in ChatGPT, but we made it eventually.

✅ Supervised Learning

I remember my aunt once told me, "The more you know about something, the more you realize how much you still don't know." And it's so true. I thought I understood supervised and unsupervised learning — but the amount of of concepts and techniques out there is unbelievable. I tried to create the best possible notes, but I ended up spending hours on them again, due to my perfectionism.

Anyways, my favourite part in creating these notes is selecting pictures for visualization.

✅ Unsupervised Learning

I feel so smart with my `03-plan-for-ChatGPT.md` because ChatGPT does exactly what I want. My ritual is that when I finish a topic, I start a new ChatGPT chat so we don’t mix different topics. In my first message, I send only one thing: my `03-plan-for-ChatGPT.md` file. And everything happens exactly the way I imagined.

I'm back. I was just in Paris for a few days, but I'm back in track. So I missed 3 days but we continue from where we finished.
