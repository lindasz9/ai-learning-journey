# Getting Started

## 07/19/2025

So today I started searching for a website to learn from or a YouTube tutorial or something. Well, it wasn't really successful. Obviously, there are some great tutorials, but I couldn't find a resource that has everything I imagined the way I imagined. It's so early in this field that there are no perfect resources. Maybe there are courses, but I want to keep it free (I already asked for some money, and I feel bad asking for more — plus, I want to save my own money).

So because there's no place that's perfect for me to learn from, I'll do it with ChatGPT. We're basically best friends, we talk so much (okay, I'm not an idiot, chill). So I plan to learn from it — we already discussed the details, I just need to start. I've had a few bad experiences with ChatGPT because sometimes it forgets things or doesn't do what I say, but this is the best choice because it's personalized, and I can ask anything and not feel stupid.

I already learned Machine Learning a few months ago, but I like to keep things organized, so I'll quickly redo my notes. I don’t want to waste much time, but it’s also good to organize knowledge.

I hate that I’m such a perfectionist. I already know this stuff, but I still spent hours creating the ultimate best notes ever. I was a bit disappointed in ChatGPT, but we made it eventually.

✅ Supervised Learning

I remember my aunt once told me, "The more you know about something, the more you realize how much you still don't know." And it's so true. I thought I understood supervised and unsupervised learning — but the amount of of concepts and techniques out there is unbelievable. I tried to create the best possible notes, but I ended up spending hours on them again, due to my perfectionism.

Anyways, my favourite part in creating these notes is selecting pictures for visualization.

✅ Unsupervised Learning

I feel so smart with my `03-plan-for-ChatGPT.md` because ChatGPT does exactly what I want. My ritual is that when I finish a topic, I start a new ChatGPT chat so we don’t mix different topics. In my first message, I send only one thing: my `03-plan-for-ChatGPT.md` file. And everything happens exactly the way I imagined.

I'm back! I spent a few days in Paris, but now I'm back on track. I may have missed three days, but we're picking up right where we left off.

✅ Reinforcement Learning

A lesson that I've learned: If you think ChatGPT doesn't do exactly what you want, you're just not prompting good enough.

✅ Hybrid Learning Techniques

I wanted to start the next topic, but I cannot upload more files for ChatGPT today, because I've reached the limit. So I'm a little angry right now. Why is it not allowing me to study? And I could copy and paste the content of the file into a message, but I've tried it, and it's not working properly. Maybe I need to buy the Plus version.

When I send ChatGPT the plan from which it knows what kind of notes to generate, the workflow doesn't stop there. So it's not just upload, send, copy, paste, done. Every topic is a 2–4 hour activity. First, I review whether the distribution of the topic is good, then I correct some parts. After that, I send a message about what should be improved, then I read it again, send another message, and again and again. If I feel everything is perfect, I gather the concepts together, and then I insert images. And yes, this takes up a few hours.

✅ ML Workflow

✅ Supervised Learning Algorithms in Python

This topic was easy I finished it under an hour. ChatGPT literally send me the structure I wanted. Perfect.

✅ Unsupervised Learning Algorithms in Python

Also was easy.
