# From Notes to Knowledge

## 09/03/2025

I decided to adjust my study structure. Instead of focusing on writing new theory notes, I will put more energy into practicing and reviewing what I have. The goal is to really know the concepts and connect them to Python code, not just collect definitions. This way, my learning will be more practical, and I'll keep building confidence in both theory and implementation.

📝 Machine Learning Overview

Some topics don’t need to be reviewed many times because they’re simpler — like the machine learning overview — but since I’m starting from the beginning, I’ll go through everything once, review it all, and then move forward.

📝 Unsupervised Learning in Python

It's so weird that I actually enjoy what I'm studying.

📝 Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is definitely a more complex topic. Reviewing it probably took me over two hours, and I still have some unanswered questions.

I think I'm gonna skip the `06-Reinforcement-in-Python.md` for now, because that's a big thing this early. I'm still just studying the theory, which I worry about, but I want to finish the whole ML topic, then build models myself.

📝 ML Workflow

Finishing the last ML topic means I now have a good grasp of the ML theory. I’m not sure whether the next step should be moving on to the next topic, deep learning, or starting to practice building ML models. I think I’ll go with the second option.
