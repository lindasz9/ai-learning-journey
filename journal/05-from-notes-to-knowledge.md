# From Notes to Knowledge

## 09/03/2025

I decided to adjust my study structure. Instead of focusing on writing new theory notes, I will put more energy into practicing and reviewing what I have. The goal is to really know the concepts and connect them to Python code, not just collect definitions. This way, my learning will be more practical, and I'll keep building confidence in both theory and implementation.
