# Hybrid Learning Techniques

## 🧠 What Are Hybrid Learning Techniques?

Hybrid learning techniques combine elements from multiple learning paradigms — including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning — to create more powerful or flexible AI systems. These techniques help models generalize better, work with less labeled data, or learn more efficiently in real-world scenarios.

## 🧩 Semi-Supervised Learning

Semi-supervised learning falls between supervised and unsupervised learning. It uses a **small amount of labeled data** together with **a large amount of unlabeled data**.

The core idea is to leverage the unlabeled data to improve model performance without requiring extensive manual labeling.

### 🔹 How It Works

1. Train a model on the labeled data
2. Use that model to infer labels (*pseudo-labeling*) on unlabeled data
3. Retrain the model using both the original and pseudo-labeled data

### 🔹 Use Cases

- Text classification with limited annotations
- Image classification where labeling is expensive (e.g., medical images)
- Speech recognition

### 🔹 Extra

- **Self-training**: A method where a model trains on its own predictions on unlabeled data.
- **Co-training**: Two models learn from different views of the data and teach each other.
- **Label propagation**: Labels spread from labeled to unlabeled points.

## 🧩 Self-Supervised Learning

Self-supervised learning uses **automatically generated labels** derived from the data itself. It teaches models to learn representations or structure without needing any human-annotated labels.

This approach is especially common in **large-scale pretraining** for foundation models.

### 🔹 How It Works

1. Construct *pretext tasks* (e.g., predict a missing word, predict image rotations)
2. Train a model on this task using unsupervised data
3. Fine-tune the model on a downstream supervised task

### 🔹 Use Cases

- **Text**: Masked word prediction, next sentence prediction  
- **Vision**: Colorization, jigsaw puzzles, rotation prediction  
- **Speech**: Predict future segments from past signals

### 🔹 Popular Models

- **Text**: BERT (masked language modeling)
- **Vision**: SimCLR, MoCo (contrastive learning)
- **Speech**: wav2vec

### 🔹 Extra:

- **Pretext task**: A simple, task used to help a model learn useful features from unlabeled data before tackling the main task.

## 🧩 Transfer Learning

Transfer learning involves **reusing a pre-trained model** on a new but related task. The goal is to **transfer knowledge** from one domain to another, reducing training time and data requirements.

### 🔹 How It Works

1. Pretrain a model on a large, general dataset (e.g., ImageNet, Wikipedia)
2. Fine-tune it on a smaller, task-specific dataset

### 🔹 Use Cases

- Image classification with limited data
- Text sentiment analysis using pre-trained transformers
- Medical diagnosis using pre-trained vision models

### 🔹 Popular Models

- **Vision**: ResNet, EfficientNet
- **Text**: BERT, GPT, RoBERTa
- **Multimodal**: CLIP, Flamingo

## 🧩 Meta-Learning (Learning to Learn)

Meta-learning refers to the process of training models that can adapt quickly to new tasks using very few examples. It's commonly known as “learning to learn.”

Instead of learning one fixed task, the model learns **how to learn** new tasks efficiently — optimizing for *adaptability* rather than raw performance on one dataset.

### 🔹 How It Works

1. The model is trained on a distribution of tasks, not just one task.  
2. During training, it learns a *meta-policy* or initialization that allows quick adaptation.  
3. When presented with a new task, the model fine-tunes quickly with only a few examples or iterations.  

### 🔹 Use Cases

- *Few-shot learning*
- *Zero-shot learning*
- Personalized recommendation
- Robotics and control systems

### 🔹 Algorithms

- **Optimization-based / gradient-based**: MAML, Reptile  
- **Metric-based**: Matching Networks, Siamese Networks  
- **Memory-based / model-based**: Neural Turing Machines, Memory-Augmented Networks

### 🔹 Extra
 - **Meta-policy**: A higher-level strategy that learns how to choose or adapt policies for different tasks.

## 🧩 Multi-task Learning

Multi-task learning (MTL) is a technique where a single model is trained to perform **multiple tasks simultaneously**. The core idea is that learning related tasks together can lead to **better generalization**, shared representations, and improved data efficiency.

### 🔹 How It Works

1. Define multiple related tasks (e.g., object detection and segmentation).
2. Use a shared backbone (e.g., neural network layers) for feature extraction.  
3. Attach task-specific heads to perform individual predictions.  
4. Train the model jointly using a combined loss function.  

### 🔹 Use Cases

- **Text**: Jointly performing part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and parsing  
- **Vision**: Simultaneous object detection and classification  

### 🔹 Extra

- **Hard parameter sharing**: Most layers are shared across tasks.  
- **Soft parameter sharing**: Each task has its own model, but parameters are regularized to be similar.  
- **Adashare**: A dynamic approach where the model learns to share different subsets of parameters across tasks by using a learned gating mechanism, enabling flexible sharing depending on the task.

## 🧩 Multi-modal Learning

Multi-modal learning involves building models that can understand and integrate information from **multiple data modalities** — such as text, images, audio, and video — rather than relying on a single type of input.

### 🔹 How It Works

1. Encode each modality using its own specialized encoder (e.g., CNN for images, Transformer for text)  
2. Fuse the outputs into a shared representation  
3. Perform predictions or reasoning tasks using the combined features  

### 🔹 Use Cases

- **Vision + Text**: Image captioning, Visual Question Answering  
- **Audio + Text**: Multimodal sentiment analysis, voice assistants  
- **Vision + Text + Audio**: Robotics, autonomous vehicles, AR/VR systems  

### 🔹 Popular Models

- **Vision + Text**: CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining), Flamingo (Few-shot visual-language reasoning), DALL·E (Text-to-image generation) 
- **Vision + Text + Audio**: Gemini (Google multimodal model)

### 🔹 Extra

- **Cross-modal attention**: Mechanism allowing one modality to attend to another (e.g., text attending to image regions).  
- **Fusion strategies**: Methods of combining information from multiple sources or modalities.
  - Early fusion: Combining data or features from different sources early, before modeling.
  - Late fusion: Processing each source separately and merging results later.
  - Hybrid fusion: Mixing early and late fusion to leverage both advantages.
