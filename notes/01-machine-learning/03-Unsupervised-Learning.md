# Unsupervised Learning

## ðŸ§  What is Unsupervised Learning?

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where models are trained on **unlabeled data**.  
The algorithm learns to find patterns, structures, or groupings in the data without explicit instructions.

## ðŸ“‚ Main Categories of Unsupervised Learning

### 1. **Clustering**
- **What it is**: Clustering is the task of grouping similar data points together based on their features.  
- **Real-world examples**:
  - Customer segmentation in marketing
  - Grouping news articles by topic
  - Detecting fraudulent behavior
  - Recommending content based on user similarity

### 2. ***Dimensionality* Reduction**
- **What it is**: *Dimensionality* reduction reduces the number of features (or dimensions) while preserving important information in the data.
- **Real-world examples**:
  - Visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D/3D
  - Noise reduction in images
  - Compressing large datasets
  - Speeding up training for other ML models

## ðŸ“˜ Clustering Algorithms

### ðŸ”¹ k-Means Clustering
- **How it works**: Partitions data into k *clusters*  by minimizing the distance between data points and their assigned *centroid*.
- **Use cases**: Customer segmentation, grouping documents, image compression.
- **Strengths**:
  - Simple and scalable
  - Works well on spherical *clusters* 
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Needs k predefined
  - Sensitive to initialization and *outliers*
  - Assumes equally sized, circular *clusters* 
- **Extras**:
  - **Elbow method**: used to choose the optimal k

### ðŸ”¹ Hierarchical Clustering
- **How it works**: Builds a tree of *clusters*  using agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down) strategies.  
- **Use cases**: Gene expression analysis, hierarchical document categorization.
- **Strengths**:
  - Doesnâ€™t need to predefine k
  - Results in a *dendrogram* showing *cluster* hierarchy
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Computationally expensive
  - Hard to scale to large datasets
- **Types**:
  - Agglomerative (most common)
  - Divisive

### ðŸ”¹ DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
- **How it works**: Groups points that are closely packed together and marks isolated points as *noise*. Classifies points as core, border, or *noise*.
- **Use cases**: Anomaly detection, spatial clustering, satellite image analysis.
- **Strengths**:
  - Doesnâ€™t need k
  - Handles arbitrary shapes of *clusters* 
  - Robust to *outliers*
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Struggles with *clusters*  of varying density
  - Sensitive to parameters (eps, minPts)
- **Extra**:
  - **Density**: The concentration of data points within a region; higher density means more points are packed closely together.
  - **Eps**: A parameter defining the maximum distance between two points for them to be considered neighbors.
  - **minPts**: A parameter that specifies the minimum number of points required to form a *cluster*.

## ðŸ“˜ *Dimensionality* Reduction Techniques

### ðŸ”¹ PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- **How it works**: Transforms data into new axes (called principal components) that capture the most *variance*.
- **Use cases**: Data visualization, feature reduction, preprocessing.
- **Strengths**:
  - Fast, linear method
  - Retains key patterns in data
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Only captures linear relationships
  - Hard to interpret components

### ðŸ”¹ t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor *Embedding*)
- **How it works**: Converts high-dimensional relationships into 2D or 3D visualizations by preserving only *local structure*.
- **Use cases**: Visualizing image *embeddings*, document clustering, genomics.
- **Strengths**:
  - Excellent for visual inspection
  - Captures complex, non-linear patterns
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Slow on large datasets
  - Results vary due to randomness

### ðŸ”¹ UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)
- **How it works**: Similar to t-SNE but preserves both *local* and *global structure* in data, optimizing manifold topology.
- **Use cases**: Faster and more scalable. Popular in bioinformatics and NLP.
- **Strengths**:
  - Faster and more stable than t-SNE
  - Better at preserving overall data structure
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Harder to interpret

## ðŸ“Š Model Evaluation

### Clustering Metrics:
- **Silhouette Score**: Measures how similar a point is to its own *cluster* vs other *clusters* .
- **Daviesâ€“Bouldin Index**: Measures average similarity between *clusters*  (lower is better).
- **Calinski-Harabasz Index**: Ratio of between-*cluster* dispersion to within-*cluster* dispersion.

### *Dimensionality* Reduction:
- **Explained *Variance***: Shows how much information is retained in fewer dimensions.

## ðŸ§  Important Concepts

- **Centroid**: The center of a *cluster* (mean of all data points in that *cluster*).  
- **Cluster**: A group of data points that are similar to each other.  
- **Dendrogram**: A tree diagram used to visualize the arrangement of the *clusters*.
- **Dimensionality**: The number of features or attributes in a dataset.  
- **Embedding**: A process of converting complex data (like words, images, or nodes) into numerical vectors that capture their meaning or relationships.
- **Global structure**: The overall shape and arrangement of data clusters or patterns across the entire dataset.  
- **Local structure**: The relationships and similarities among data points that are close to each other in the dataset.    
- **Noise**: Irrelevant or random data points that don't belong to any clear *cluster*.  
- **Outlier**: A data point that lies far away from other points and may distort analysis.  
- **Principal component**: New orthogonal axes created by PCA that maximize *variance*.  
- **Variance**: The amount of spread in the data or how much information a component captures.
