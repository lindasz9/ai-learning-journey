# Machine Learning Overwiew

## 🧠 What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

## 📂 Main Categories of Machine Learning

### 1. **Supervised Learning**
- Learns from **labeled** data (input-output pairs).
- The goal is to map inputs to known outputs.
- Types: regression, classification.
- Algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, etc.

### 2. **Unsupervised Learning**
- Learns patterns from **unlabeled** data.
- The model tries to uncover hidden structures.
- Types: clustering, dimensionality reduction.
- Algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN, PCA, etc.

### 3. **Reinforcement Learning**
- An agent learns by interacting with an environment.
- Learns through rewards and penalties.
- Common in robotics, game AI, and control systems.
- Algorithms: Q-Learning, Policy Gradients.

### 4. **Hybrid Learning Techniques**
- Combines elements of supervised and unsupervised learning.
- Types: Semi-supervised, Self-supervised, Transfer Learning, Meta-learning.

## 🛠️ General ML Workflow

1. Define the problem
2. Collect and clean the data
3. Split data into train/test sets
4. Choose an algorithm
5. Train the model
6. Evaluate the model
7. Tune hyperparameters
8. Deploy the model

## 🧰 Common Tools and Libraries

- **Python** – The main language used in ML development.
- **scikit-learn** – Library for ML algorithms and utilities (classification, regression, clustering, etc.).
- **NumPy** – Efficient numerical operations and array handling.
- **pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis (especially for tabular data).
- **Matplotlib / seaborn** – Visualization libraries for plotting data and model results.
- **Jupyter Notebooks** – Interactive environment for writing and running code.
