# Deep Learning Overview

## 🧠 What is Deep Learning?

Deep Learning is a specialized subset of Machine Learning that focuses on algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain’s neural networks. It automatically discovers features and patterns from large datasets using multiple layers of processing.

It excels in tasks involving unstructured data such as images, audio, video, and natural language.

## 🧩 Key Differences from Machine Learning

| Feature                  | Machine Learning                   | Deep Learning                            |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Feature Engineering      | Manual                             | Automatic via multiple layers             |
| Data Requirement         | Works with smaller datasets        | Requires large volumes of data            |
| Performance on Raw Data  | Poor                               | Excellent (e.g. images, text, audio)      |
| Execution Time           | Fast (usually)                     | Slower training, faster inference         |
| Hardware Requirements    | Low to moderate                    | High (especially GPUs)                    |

## 🧬 Why “Deep”?

The “deep” refers to the number of **hidden layers** in the neural network. While traditional neural networks have one or two layers, deep networks have dozens, sometimes even hundreds, allowing them to model complex, abstract relationships.

## 🔍 What Deep Learning Can Do

- **Image Recognition**  
  Automatically classifies images (e.g., face detection, medical imaging).

- **Natural Language Processing**  
  Powers translation, sentiment analysis, chatbots, summarization, and more.

- **Speech Recognition**  
  Converts spoken language into written text.

- **Recommendation Systems**  
  Learns user preferences from behavior and predicts future choices.

- **Autonomous Vehicles**  
  Helps detect objects, understand environments, and make real-time decisions.

- **Generative AI**  
  Can generate new content (text, images, audio, or even code).

## 🛠️ Components of Deep Learning

- **Artificial Neurons (Perceptrons)** – The fundamental building block.
- **Layers**  
  - *Input Layer* – Receives raw data  
  - *Hidden Layers* – Extract features and patterns  
  - *Output Layer* – Produces the final prediction
- **Activation Functions** – Introduce non-linearity (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid, tanh)
- **Loss Functions** – Measure how far predictions are from targets
- **Optimizers** – Adjust weights to minimize loss (e.g., SGD, Adam)
